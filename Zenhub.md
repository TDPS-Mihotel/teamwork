### Detailed panel operations

#### Establish new issues

This is the most basic and simple step to start our project management.
- New issues can be created by simply clicking on the green bond **New Issue** in the following picture.

⚠️Generally, team members are supposed to establish issues in Github. Zenhub is just a tool to help us have an eye on our project progress.

#### Panel setting up

This part is one of the most important step to do the project management which is related to the **division of team members** and the **project progress**. Therefore, in order to **develope the project systematically** and **finish the project on time**, it is necessary to learn how to set up the panel.

- The following figure is the panel setting up page, which will appear automatically as soon as the users click on **New Issues** bond.

##### How to import the content of the issue into the panel

![](Tutorial_Zenhub/import.png)

As we can see here, the left part of the setting up page is the region for the content of the issue, including **Issue Title**, **Comment**, **Overview** and **File Attaching**.

- **Issue Title**

It is obvious that this region is for issue title.

- **Writing a comment & Attaching files**

This region is used for describing the detailed content of the issue, including **Issue content**, **Division of group members** and **The fils which are probably needed to solve the issue**.

- **Preview**

This region is used for **previewing what the panel is about to look like** so that **necessary adjustments can be done before pulling the panel to the pipe line**.

##### Setting of **Labels**

Issues can be divided into **several categories** as shown below. While setting the new issue, remind that **do not forget to mark the issue with labels** so that the team members are able to figure out what exactly category this issue belongs to. This can improve our efficiency.

  ##### How to **evolve the group members into the issue**.

This step is somehow similar to dividing tasks to group members. Als it can be regarded as the function of **@**. It can be simply achieved to evolve the group members by clicking the bond **Asignees** showed below.

##### How to evolve an issue into Epic.

This step is to **classify different issues**. As we have mentioned before, **Epic** is used to store similar or related issues. It is a good habit to classify the issues at the stage of developing an new issue. The newly established issue can be put into a proper Epic by clicking **Epics** bond shown below.

![](Tutorial_Zenhub/Epics_Classify.png)

After Clicking **Epics** bond, the existing Epics will be shown immediately. Simply click the related Epic so that the new issue will be put into this Epic.

#### How to set the emergency level.

- Setting of **High Priority**

At the right part of the setting up page, there is a **pin shape bond**, **on the top**, which represents **Setting this issue as a high priority issue**.
The detailed bond is shown in the following picture.

- Except forHigh Priority, Issues can be moved freely in the pipe line. So the level of emergency can be simply set by moving issues freely in the pipe line.
